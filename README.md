NEUBEdumates (An educational based social media platform) is a social media
website to connect the NEUBian in one platform to share their Share ideas and daily
activities, collaborate with each other, and get educational help also. NEUB students can
create an account by the user authentication system and a valid user can access this
application. they can create a post, like, comment, and reply to any post. Also, they can
follow and unfollow other users. there will be some educational features in our application
which are E-library, Question Bank, Results, CGPA calculator, Notice board, Class routine,
etc. also there will be an interesting feature which is the class update section. Where only
teachers can create a classroom and they can post class update time and attach file. Students
can comment there. To implement this system we used React-Hook for the Front-end, Node.js
for controlling the back-end, MongoDB as a database.
